This repository contains the code where I practice Data Structures

## Youtube Playlist

This is one of the best [youtube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn49bJOYAZM&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ), created by [Kunal Kushwaha](https://www.youtube.com/c/KunalKushwaha) that I have come across for learning Data Structures using Java.

The main git repo followed by Kunal is [here](https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DSA-Bootcamp-Java).

This is how I plant to gai significant knowledge on Data Structures and Algorithms. 

1. Complete the video playlist mentioned above
2. Finish the following 2 coursera courses
 - [Algorithms - Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
 - [Algorithms - Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)
3. Following which I also plan to solve questions from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
4. Reading and practicing the problems from Cracking the coding interview book
